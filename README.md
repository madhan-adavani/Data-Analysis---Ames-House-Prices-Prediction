# Data-Analysis---Ames-House-Prices-Prediction
This repository contains a data analysis project for predicting house prices in Ames, Iowa using machine learning techniques. The project involves exploring, analyzing, and visualizing a dataset of house prices, and building and evaluating machine learning models for predicting house prices based on various features.

## Project Overview
- The project uses Python programming language and popular data science libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn.
- The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle's Ames Housing dataset, which contains data on various features of residential properties in Ames, Iowa, along   with their corresponding sale prices.
- The project follows a typical data science workflow, including data exploration, data preprocessing, feature engineering and feature selection.
- The project includes Jupyter notebooks that document the entire data analysis process, from data loading to feature selection, with detailed explanations and code       comments.
